What is encoding? - a mapping of text between human-readable characters and numeric codes(binary)

ASCII(American Standerd Code for Information Interchange)
- Oldest widely used encoding
- 128 characters -> 7 bit(align to 8 bit)
- limited to English content

GBK(Chinese National Standerd Extension)
- Covers simplified and traditional Chinese characters
- Backward compatible with ASCII
- Popular in mainland China before Unicode became dominant

Unicode
- ** Not a encoding itself **
- a table of mappings

UTF-32
- Stores each Unicode code point directly in 4 bytes
- Simple but wasteful

UTF-8
-Variable-length(1 -> 4 bytes)
-Today's default, most universal encoding
